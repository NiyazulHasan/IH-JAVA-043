SDLC
=====
SDLC stands Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of software's.

We have six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 
2) Analysis
3) Designing 
4) Coding 
5) Testing 
6) Delivery and Maintainence

1) Feasibility study 
---------------------
Feasibility study depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T	-	Technical Feasibility 
	E 	-	Economical Feasibility 
	L 	-	Legal Feasibility 
	O	-	Operational Feasibility 
	S 	-	Schedule Feasibility 

All the above information we will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Design Document.


2) Analysis
---------------
In this phase, System analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

They will keep all the above information in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3) Designing 
--------------
We have two types of designing.

1) High level designing 

2) Low level designing 

1) High level designing 
--------------------------
> A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

> In high level designing , we will design main modules or major modules.

2) Low level designing 
------------------------
> A team lead or project lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

> In low level desiging , we will design child modules or sub modules.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.

4) Coding 
------------
In this phase, developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build.

Once if our build is ready then we need to perform unit testing.


5) Testing
-----------
In this phase, Testing Team or QA team will involved.

Testing team is responsible to test the code by using a software component called STLC.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

Testing teams makes our project as bug free.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
----------------------------
Before delivery , company performs UAT testing.

UAT stands User Acceptance Testing.

It is divided into two types.

i) Alpha Testing 

ii) Beta Testing
