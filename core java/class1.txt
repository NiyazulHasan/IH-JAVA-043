Comments in Java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommended to use comments in regular programming.

Diagram: class1.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, We have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 

2) Multiple line comment 

1) Single line comment 
----------------------
It is used to comment a single line.
Ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple line comment
------------------------
It is used to comment multiple lines.
Ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

Program
--------

//class declaration 
class  Test
{
	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//variable declaration 
		int n=2;

		//logic to find out even or odd
		if((n&1)==0)
			System.out.println("Even");
		else
			System.out.println("Odd");
	}
}

or

Java is a versatile language which is used to develop various types of applications like standalone applications, desktop applications, distributed applications, enterprise applications, networking applications, ERP applications , mobile applications and etc.

Diagram: class1.2



Q) Is JVM platform dependent or independent?

JVM consider as platform dependent.	 



Q) What is project?

It is an individual or collaborative work in a enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim/goal.

Technically , a project is a collection of modules.

ex:
	Admin module 
	customer module 
	registartion module 
	report generation module
	payment module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1) Technical domain 
------------------
	Technical domain describes using which technology we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2) Functional domain 
---------------------
	Functional domain describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Banking domain 
		Insaurance domain 
		ERP domain 
		and etc.
